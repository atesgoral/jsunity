# jsUnity

<pre>This project has been retired a long time ago, after some proper JavaScript unit test frameworks emerged.</pre> 

jsUnity is a lightweight JavaScript testing framework that is context-agnostic. 
It doesnâ€™t rely on any browser capabilities and therefore can be run inside 
HTML, ASP, WSH or any other context that uses JavaScript/JScript/ECMAScript.
